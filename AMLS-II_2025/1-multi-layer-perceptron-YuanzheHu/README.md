# 1-MULTI-LAYER-PERCEPTRON

## Using GitHub
If this is your first time using GitHub, it would be useful to complete the _Git & GitHub Fundamentals_ assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/c5Me39XH.
This assignment illustrates the basic functionalities of GitHub and how to work with them.

## Intended Learning Outcomes
* Understand the concept of Feature Engineering, illustrated in the context of a facial recognition task.
* Create and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using Tensorflow Keras.
* Explore methodologies to improve a model's architecture to increase performances.

## Instructions
* Make sure you have completed the setup assignment (link on Moodle). 
* Complete all the tasks in `1-multi-layer-perceptron.ipynb`.
* When finished, merge the Pull Request created by GitHub Classroom.

> [!CAUTION]
> This action is not reversible, do NOT merge until you are sure that you are satisfied with your work.

* When released on Moodle, use the solution password to unzip `1-multi-layer-perceptron-solutions.zip` and compare with your work.
